## About the Video Course
MySQL is the world’s most popular open source database. Since the release of MySQL 5.0 in 2003, it is MySQL 8 that comes with a major update. 

This course goes over the basics of MySQL administration, through examples on MySQL 8. It also covers the differences between various MySQL versions. It starts off with the basics: Installing MySQL and Creating users. After that, we will get sysbench up and running. Sysbench, responsible for issuing queries against databases, is the de-facto benchmarking tool for MySQL. With that hands-on lab environment at hand, we will learn about various database administration topics like backups, replication, monitoring, point in time recovery, switchovers, user management and version upgrades.

Upon completing this course, you will be able to set up new MySQL databases and perform basic administration tasks using the latest version.
